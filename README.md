## WEB SCRAPPING

I used Beautifulsoup to scrape the price of house for Abia and Imo from a real estate website, [jiji](https://jiji.ng/real-estate?utm_source=google_adw&utm_medium=4040486029&utm_campaign=11830024291&utm_content=117958148329&utm_term=558353030862&gclid=CjwKCAjwu_mSBhAYEiwA5BBmf_3F8ChS1MDCJYDWsdfZKASXehk_dpHH6tE29aDoPXTneJyCfMfl4RoC7pYQAvD_BwE ) and that of Enugu from [Nigeria Property Center](https://nigeriapropertycentre.com/). I was not able to see any data for Imo and Abia from these websites.

# My Observations:
* I bedrooom Flat is more expensive in Imo than Enugu and Anambra.
* Among the three states, Enugu pays the least rent for a 2 Bedroom flat
* The rent of a 3 bedroom flat is more expensive in Anambra than Imo and Enugu, while the rent paid for 3 bedroom bungalows is higher than a 3 bedroom flat in Enugu but less for Imo
* Anambra state residents pay more for a four bedroom duplex, followed closely by Imo and then Enugu
